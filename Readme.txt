Welcome to my first open source project. 

Steps to take:

1. Clone the files to your local machine by using Git clone command. 
2. Navigate to your desired path where files are cloned.
3. By using "npm i" install all required dependencies.
4. Modify code to add some originality.
5. Final step is to run index.js with ndemon by using command "nodemon index.js"


This project is created mainly for learning and fun, I am sure it is lacking on many fields. But it is reflecting my progress so I am happy to share it with everyone. 

I would really appreciate some constructive critics.
